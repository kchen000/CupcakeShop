Yangaroo Take Home Interview

This is your takeaway question. You will be required to email us back your answer within 3 days (unless there are extenuating circumstances).

Problem 1
We are going to be opening up a Cupcake shop! As the owner, I would like to see a simple web application where I can enter the following data:
1. Cupcake name
2. Cupcake price
3. Date cupcake was created
4. Date cupcake was last modified
Once that data is entered, I would like to be able to have a listing of all my entries. I would like to be able to edit any entry I select, as well as deleting any entry.
Using ASP.NET MVC4 (Framework v4.5), we would like a simple site with the following requirements:
- Use SQLExpress for your database
- DO NOT use ORM (e.g. EntityFramework or LINQ2SQL)
- MUST use Razor views
- Please demonstrate the use of at LEAST one editor template
- Please demonstrate the use of at LEAST one layout template
- Please demonstrate the use of at LEAST one partial view
- All fields are required, must demonstrate the use of validation, must have both client and
server side validation (for client-side, please use unobtrusive validation)

Problem 2
NOTE: Make your changes in the existing TFS workspace you created for the above problem. Check in
your changes to the existing TFS project. Do not create a new TFS project.
1. Add ability to manage ‘Ingredients’ for Cupcakes.
2. Update any related view to reflect this change.
3. Demonstrate the use of jQuery (any version > 1.6)
Please demonstrate one thing that you think is creative. Maybe you want to use some cool CSS, maybe
you're going to design a flashy layout. Maybe you're going to use some really neat jQuery plugin. Maybe
you've got some cool code you want to show off. It can be anything, surprise us!
